# Weekend JQuery Salary Calculator

## Description

_Duration: 15 Hrs._

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it? 

This project was created to add employees First Name, their Last Name, their ID, their Title, and their Annual Salary to a table.  After the employees were added to the table their annual salary was adjusted to see the monthly company cost.  If the monthly cost exceeded $20000 the value displayed on the DOM would change to red. A delete button was created to help in the event that an incorrect data was entered. No initial files were provided.

I built the program from scratch using CSS, HTML, Javascript, and JQuery. The only information provided was a screenshot to show what was anticipated for the final turn in.
